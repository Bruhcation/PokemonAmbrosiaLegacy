- All Pokémon have one or more abilities.
  - Some are the abilities you might expect such a Tyranitar Sandstream.

- Pokémon wander in the overworld. They randomly spawn and come in 3 varieties.
  - Normal Pokémon that appear in various colours and are at an appropriate level.
  - Aggressive Pokémon that appear red and will attack the player on sight, they are at high levels and can only be escaped from by using a Pokedoll.

## Story

- The story is completely new and centers on an immanent invasion of Kanto due to a war with Hoen.

## World

- Many updated maps and numerous all new maps.
- Random battle weather assigned upon entering an area, though some maps have fixed weather.  
- With a more open world design allowing the player to enter areas with trainers and Pokémon far stronger than they would be able to beat but with hidden powerful rewards.
  - Can travel north to Blackthorn and west to Olivine from the beginning of the game.
  - Can travel to Kanto as soon as reaching Goldenrod.

## Level Caps

Open world design is balanced by two levels caps, both of which are visible on your trainer card and increase upon defeating Gym leaders.
  - Cap on the max level you can train Pokémon to, this is a generous cap that starts at 20 and is generally slightly higher than the next gym leaders max level.
  - Cap on the max level of Pokémon you can capture. This is generally 10 less than your training level cap.

## Quality of Life

Many massively impactful quality of life changes.
- Can rematch any trainer by talking to them, including Gym leaders. However, rematches give reduced exp and forbid the use of items.
- Can forfeit almost any battle via the Run option.
- Exp share available from very early game, giving 50% exp to all Pokémon who do not participate. This is upgraded by endgame to give 200% exp to all Pokémon.
- Sport Shoes which allows the player to run by default (rather than having to hold B) except when indoors where walking is the default (though you can still run by holding B).
- A Remembral key item which acts as a portable move relearner with no cost.
- All TMs are infinitely reusable.
- HMs can be used by any Pokémon which is able to learn them, without actually needing to know them.
- A Pocket PC allowing access to PC anywhere except caves and dungeons for balance reasons.
- Pocket PC also acts as a portable Pokémon Center
- An infinitely reusable escape rope called Escape Pod.
- An infinitely reusable repel called a Repulsor.
- Warp Device which lets the player instantly warp to important locations.

## Entertaining Features

- Fully revamped battle frontier including 5 areas
    - Battle Mirror where you battle an exact copy of your current team.
    - Battle Roulette where you battle a random boss enemy you have fought before and receive a random reward.
    - Battle Arcade where you select a team to use, then an enemy to fight against from a selection of Gym Leader, Elite Four and boss teams. You start with all Gym leaders and unlock other characters as you play through the story.
    - Battle trial where you face consecutive story enemies of increasing strength 	with your party only being healed every three fights.
    - Battle tower which now consists of four 6v6 fights with no rules and has five difficulties.
    - Battle tower (mirror mode) here instead of using your own party you use an exact copy of the random enemy party. Keeping the fights interesting.
- A recurring RPG minigame where the player plays through stories from popular IPs such as Star Wars, DBZ and Lord of the Rings where the player takes part in battles with fixed teams.
- Invader enemy class based on dark souls invaders. They don't generally have high level Pokémon but their Pokémon are min-maxed and they utilize meta strategies. They are all avoidable.

## AI

AI has been extensively improved. At all times it has knowledge of
- Whether it has any moves that can 1HKO, 2HKO or 3HKO the player from both their current and max health.
- Whether the player has any moves that can 1HKO, 2HKO or 3HKO the AI from both its current and max health.
- Whether the AI can outspeed the player.
- What item the player Pokémon has.
- Whether the AI is choice locked into a resisted move, it will switch out in this case.  
- It does NOT know what specific move the player has selected on their turn.

It uses all these to make decisions, take these moves for example
- Recover
  - AI will use if it will only get one more turn before being defeated by the player.
  - Unless the player can 2HKO AI from max HP, no point using recover in that case.
  
- Swords Dance
  - AI will use if it will be able to get off at least one attack after using it.
  - It will not use if the player can 1HKO unless all the following are true
    - The AI outspeeds player
    - AI has intact focus sash or sturdy
    - The player does not have a priority move
